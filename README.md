   <h2 align="center">Project Overview<b></h2>
<h6>In this project we were able to recreate a web page based off a figma file given and implement the mobile screen size viewing for when the user switches the web pages width to 480px or less. Once the pages width reached 480px or less, we allowed the nav bar to turn into a hamburger menu icon and hide the nav bar until the menu button was pressed</h6>
